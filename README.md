2. Instructions  


## 1. Introduction ##
This project concerns the Boston House Price Dataset, a dataset that comes with sklearn. For the Machine Learning and STatistics Module of the GMIT Higher Diploma in Data Anayltics, we are tasked with:  

* Describing the dataset.  
* Looking at wherther proximity to the Charles River has an impact on the house prices.  
* Building a model so we could predict house prices.  

This repository is composed of a Jupyter Notebook and a README.md file. Other components of the repository support these two main aspects _e.g._ images, data, licenses and git ignore files. This project is completed as the main assessment for the Machine Learning and Statistics Module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics program run by GMIT.  
  
The README.md file gives instructions on how to access the repository and a synopsis of the project. The Jupyter notebook details the code, results and subsequent analysis.  

There a number of data files included in the repository at submission, namely:  
* results.csv - results of multiple iterations / variations of parameters in finding the best solution.  
* seeded_results.csv - a snapshot of the file as submitted in case the original s overwritten if code is run again.  
* unseeded_results.csv - a snapshot of results prior to seeding.  
* ppTogether_results.csv - a variation where preprocessing was done on the data prior to training / testing split.  

All these are purposely included for reference if required.  

## 2. Instructions ##
