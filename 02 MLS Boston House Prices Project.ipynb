    "**_zn_** : proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_indus_** : proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_chas_** : Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).\n",

    "**_nox_** : nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).\n",
    "\n",
    "**_rm_** : average number of rooms per dwelling.\n",

    "**_age_** : proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.\n",
